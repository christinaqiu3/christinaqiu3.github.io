                        In the summer of 2020, in the midst of the pandemic,
                        I stayed home all day with the air conditioner and reminisced about previous summers,
                        when I traveled to different places and the only way to escape from the unbearable heat
                        was a cool drink.

                        Realism in the soft and sharp detailed folds of the blanket is contrasted by the strange
                        otherworldly coloring in the face, blurred at times with the haziness that comes with sleeping,
                        yet also with harsh shadows due to the unpleasant dream. The heavy blankets bound me to my bed.
                        I cannot come to
                        reality— I will never escape the nightmare.

The photograph of the model has warm lighting, which is stripped away by the blue tones of the painting, creating a cold, lonely atmosphere. Viewing the space in third person, I assembled the pieces as I would in my own mind.<br></br><br></br>
